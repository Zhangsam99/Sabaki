Generic options:
  -h [ --help ]                         Show commandline options.
  -g [ --gtp ]                          Enable GTP mode.
  -t [ --threads ] arg (=0)             Number of threads to use. Select 0 to
                                        let leela-zero pick a reasonable
                                        default.
  -p [ --playouts ] arg                 Weaken engine by limiting the number of
                                        playouts. Requires --noponder.
  -v [ --visits ] arg                   Weaken engine by limiting the number of
                                        visits.
  -b [ --lagbuffer ] arg (=100)         Safety margin for time usage in
                                        centiseconds.
  -r [ --resignpct ] arg (=-1)          Resign when winrate is less than x%.
                                        -1 uses 10% but scales for handicap.
  -w [ --weights ] arg (=C:\Programs\leela-zero-0.17-cpuonly-win64\best-network)
                                        File with network weights.
  -l [ --logfile ] arg                  File to log input/output to.
  -q [ --quiet ]                        Disable all diagnostic output.
  --timemanage arg (=auto)              [auto|on|off|fast|no_pruning] Enable
                                        time management features.
                                        auto = no_pruning when using -n,
                                        otherwise on.
                                        on = Cut off search when the best move
                                        can't change, but use full time if
                                        moving faster doesn't save time.
                                        fast = Same as on but always plays
                                        faster.
                                        no_pruning = For self play training
                                        use.

  --noponder                            Disable thinking on opponent's time.
  --benchmark                           Test network and exit. Default args:

Self-play options:
  -n [ --noise ]                        Enable policy network randomization.
  -s [ --seed ] arg                     Random number generation seed.
  -d [ --dumbpass ]                     Don't use heuristics for smarter

  --randomvisits arg (=1)               Don't play random moves if they have <=
